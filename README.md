# Dog-Breeds-Image-Classifier
### Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

## Overview
->Using an image classification application using a deep learning model called a convolutional neural network (often abbreviated as CNN). <br>
->Using a CNN that has already learned the features from a giant dataset of 1.2 million images called ImageNet.<br>
<b>Dataset Source:-</b> <a href="https://image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>
<br>
->Exploring the three different architectures (AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet) and determining which are best for the application.<br>

## Problem
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information. Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs. Develop Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.

## Principal Objectives
1. Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.<br>

2. Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.<br>

<b>Other:</b> Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.<br>
